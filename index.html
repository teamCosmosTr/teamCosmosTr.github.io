            class="section-image">
        <p>Eutrophication is a global environmental issue resulting in degraded water quality, changes in ecosystems and
            economic distribution in industries like agriculture, fishery, and tourism. Our Kraken is a cutting-edge
            water filtration system that uses a cellulose-graphene filter membrane to improve water quality and fight
            eutrophication.
            <br>
            The purpose of Kraken is twofold: to provide an eco-friendly alternative to traditional water filtration
            systems and to repurpose invasive algae that harm aquatic ecosystems. With our easy-to-use, modular
            filtration units, consumers can integrate Kraken into water treatment facilities, agricultural irrigation
            systems, and industrial processes.

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <img src="image1.jpeg" alt="Innovation Image" style="max-width: 0%; height: auto; margin-bottom: 20px;"
            class="section-image">
        <p>Using surplus algaeâ€”one of the main byproducts of eutrophicationâ€”we synthesize cellulose, a key part of our
            filtration technology, as a sustainable solution. Our unique approach not only purifies water but also
            reduces the ecological impact of invasive algae species, contributing to the restoration of aquatic
            ecosystems and ensuring cleaner water for communities and industries.

        <h2>Why Kraken?</h2>
        <img src="image2.2.jpg" alt="Impact Image" style="max-width: 0%; height: auto; margin-bottom: 20px;"
            class="section-image">
        <p>Chemical treatments, mechanical filtration systems, and biological remediation methods are the conventional
            treatment means our innovation competes with. These approaches may work well for some classes of pollutants,
            but due to their high operational cost (i.e., power driven procedures), the need for power and the
            contaminant scavenging capabilities it possesses, these are usually limited. Despite that, our
            cellulose-graphene membrane technology offers a complete solution by effectively managing inorganic and
            organic contaminants.
            <br>
            Kraken provides a new strategy for stopping water pollution and eutrophication. Unlike the usual filtration
            systems which often use artificial materials and a lot of energy, our algae-based technology is economical,
            sustainable, and ecologically benign.

            class="section-image">
        <p>Kraken uses invasive algae in order to restore aquatic ecosystems by reducing the negative effects that their
            proliferation causes and reestablishing the equilibrium of impacted water bodies. Our efforts have also
            produced readily available clean water. Our filtering technology supports public health and economic
            development by ensuring that communities, businesses, and agricultural systems have access to clean water.
            <br>
            Reducing Waste: By converting algal waste, Kraken transforms the environmental hazard into a useful
            resource.

        <p>The benefits of our Kraken like the dual-action nature, scalability, and eco-friendliness ensure its
            competitiveness within the growing market for eco-friendly water treatment technologies, despite the
            challenging aspects associated with the use of graphene and its high cost. The benefits of our method such
